*In the Same Boats* is a work of multimodal scholarship designed to encourage the collaborative production of humanistic knowledge within scholarly communities.

It presents opportunities for unearthing the extent to which Caribbean, Latin American, African, European, and Afro-American intellectuals have been in both punctual and sustained conversation with one another: attending the same conferences, publishing in the same journals and presses, active in the same political groups, perhaps even elbow-to-elbow in the same Parisian cafés and on the same transatlantic crossings––literally and metaphorically in the same boats––as they circulate throughout the Americas, Africa, Europe, and beyond.
