## WHAT this is

*In the Same Boats* is a work of multimodal scholarship designed to encourage the collaborative production of humanistic knowledge within scholarly communities. The platform comprises two interactive visualizations that trace the movements of significant cultural actors from the Caribbean and wider Americas, Africa, and Europe within the 20th century Afro-Atlantic world. It presents opportunities for unearthing the extent to which Caribbean, Latin American, African, European, and Afro-American intellectuals have been in both punctual and sustained conversation with one another: attending the same conferences, publishing in the same journals and presses, active in the same political groups, perhaps even elbow-to-elbow in the same Parisian cafés and on the same transatlantic crossings––literally and metaphorically in the same boats––as they circulate throughout the Americas, Africa, Europe, and beyond.

## WHY this is

One of the greatest challenges for postcolonial scholars of Africa and its diasporas is that of navigating nation-language frontiers that are the legacies of colonialism. The partitioning of the postcolonial into anglophone, francophone, hispanophone, and lusophone spaces persists—despite being in so many ways at odds with the shared socio-cultural and historical realities of the Afro-Atlantic. Same Boats pushes back against the academic balkanization of black Atlantic intellectual production, of retracing limits and contours largely determined by imperial metropoles. 
 
In presenting a series of individual maps produced on a common template by specialists of the different linguistic regions of the western Atlantic world, Same Boats seeks to counter the Euro-lingual constraints and attendant border-drawing that too often keep Caribbeanist, Latin-Americanist, Africanist, Afro-Europeanist, and Afro-Americanist scholars from engaging in deeply transnational and transcolonial dialogue, hindering us from seeing connections or from fully imagining a networked Afro-intellectual world. Literally mapping the network of Afro-diasporic intellectual, political, and aesthetic figures in the 20thcentury, Same Boats offers visual corroboration of the work of scholars who have long committed to thinking the Afro-Atlantic as an integrally networked chronotope. This platform aims to facilitate a physical tracing of hemispheric black studies – to provide a point of departure from which to highlight the various sites wherein Afro-Atlantic intellectual traditions may have been born and/or shepherded into the world.

## HOW this works
 
### TRAJECTORIES

This visualization presents an interactive narrative overview of one or more individuals’ movements through space over time. The timeline function allows for the researcher to consider specific periods or phases. You can select figures individually or you can compare them to others by selecting them.

<p>1. Select a range of time by clicking and dragging one of the dots or "handles" at the bottom or top of the timeline slider in the "Select Range" column. Notice that the header dates change at the top of the slider as you move either of the handles.</p>
<p>2. Select one or more authors on the "Select Authors" column. Once selected, you can deselect an author by clicking on their name again.</p>

<p>3. Once the map has been drawn, you can select any dot on the map to read a pop-up note about that particular moment in time for that particular author.</p>

### INTERSECTIONS

This visualization presents an interactive snapshot overview of the world map that reflects the presence of Afro-Atlantic figures in particular geographical locations at particular points in time. Clicking on a given city reveals which figures were present in that place and when they were there. We have worked to preserve a sense of ambiguity when a range of time is not certain. This uncertainty is indicated via the transparent aura encircling each dot. The size of the aura indicates the level of ambiguity.

<p>1. Select a range of time by clicking and dragging one of the dots or "handles" at the bottom or top of the timeline slider in "Select Range." Notice that the time frame changes at the top of the column as you move either of the handles.</p>
<p>2. Select a dot on the map to see what figures were at that spot in the same time range.</p>

### GET ON THE MAP

Same Boats is a fundamentally collaborative venture—an invitation of sorts meant to provide our community with the opportunity to participate in the development of a unique platform and to imagine research projects and pedagogical initiatives that transgress the geo-political borders separating the various nations of the Americas. 

If you’re interested in being a part of this project by proposing an additional figure or in working with one of our existing figures/editors, please contact us at thesameboats@gmail.com.
