The platform comprises two interactive visualizations that trace the movements of significant cultural actors from the Caribbean and wider Americas, Africa, and Europe within the 20th century Afro-Atlantic world. It presents opportunities for unearthing the extent to which Caribbean, Latin American, African, European, and Afro-American intellectuals have been in both punctual and sustained conversation with one another: attending the same conferences, publishing in the same journals and presses, active in the same political groups, perhaps even elbow-to-elbow in the same Parisian cafés and on the same transatlantic crossings––literally and metaphorically in the same boats––as they circulate throughout the Americas, Africa, Europe, and beyond.</p><p><br /></p><h2 id="why-this-is">WHY this is</h2><p>One of the greatest challenges for postcolonial scholars of Africa and its diasporas is that of navigating nation-language frontiers that are the legacies of colonialism. The partitioning of the postcolonial into anglophone, francophone, hispanophone, and lusophone spaces persists—despite being in so many ways at odds with the shared socio-cultural and historical realities of the Afro-Atlantic. Same Boats pushes back against the academic balkanization of black Atlantic intellectual production, of retracing limits and contours largely determined by imperial metropoles.</p><p>In presenting a series of individual maps produced on a common template by specialists of the different linguistic regions of the western Atlantic world, Same Boats seeks to counter the Euro-lingual constraints and attendant border-drawing that too often keep Caribbeanist, Latin-Americanist, Africanist, Afro-Europeanist, and Afro-Americanist scholars from engaging in deeply transnational and transcolonial dialogue, hindering us from seeing connections or from fully imagining a networked Afro-intellectual world. Literally mapping the network of Afro-diasporic intellectual, political, and aesthetic figures in the 20thcentury, Same Boats offers visual corroboration of the work of scholars who have long committed to thinking the Afro-Atlantic as an integrally networked chronotope. This platform aims to facilitate a physical tracing of hemispheric black studies – to provide a point of departure from which to highlight the various sites wherein Afro-Atlantic intellectual traditions may have been born and/or shepherded into the world.</p><p><br /></p><h2 id="how-this-works">HOW this works</h2><h3 id="trajectories">TRAJECTORIES</h3><p>This visualization presents an interactive narrative overview of one or more individuals’ movements through space over time.

Clicking on a given city reveals which figures were present in that place and when they were there. We have worked to preserve a sense of ambiguity when a range of time is not certain. This uncertainty is indicated via the transparent aura encircling each dot. The size of the aura indicates the level of ambiguity.</p><p>1.
